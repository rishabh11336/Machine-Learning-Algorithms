# Linear Regression

## Remember the line equation all of us learned in High School

## Let’s take a data consist of year and income per capita of Canada. And find intercept and slope by plotting all point on graph by keeping `x-axis` for `year` and `y-axis` for `per capita income`.

## In equation of line `y = mx + b` “m is slope or coef_” and “b is intercept_”. For this dataset we will take years in x variable and per capita income in y variable

## After plotting all the data points on x-y plane we can see data has a linear pattern per capita income is increasing with increasing years. After running linear regression we get straight line which is a best fit line with least amount of error with respect to data as trained model. Which we can see in below image
